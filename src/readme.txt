
to be done:
1) for river bc, need to open boundary marsks? same for sediment bc
2) sediment bc need to be re-organized
3) vegetation generates organic production to morphology; sediment trapping

if manning_type=uniform and subgrid is on, I used a fixed cd. This can reduce the subgrid velocity and bed evolution within a coarse grid. JUST for experimental use.

IMPORTANT: 2016-01-13
in version 13 and 14, the advection terms were modified, which are shown not correct and not stable.
In this version (15), they were corrected. Return back to version 12 and before.
